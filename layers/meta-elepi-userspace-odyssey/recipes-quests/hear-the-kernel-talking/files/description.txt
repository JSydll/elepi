The kernel is an orchestrator behind the scenes - but you can talk to it!

Most of the time, interactions with the kernel are rather invisible. Yet, there are means to read what it's doing - and to pass information to it from user space... But be aware that not everything that looks like a call from the kernel actually originated from there!

For an introduction, you may consult:
- Vasquez, Simmonds (2021): Mastering Embedded Linux Programming, pp. 111.
- Love (2010): Linux Kernel Development, pp. 364.

Looking at the system boot might be a good start for the quest, given the kernel is heavily involved there...
